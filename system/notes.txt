#Working with SVG on VSCODE: 
1. Install SVG extension
-> ext:svg , then find SVG (created by Jock)

Running code:
python system/systemcode.py

Code explanation:
1. 3 Types of phrases accounted for:
Spike/Mode: "The spike around 1000 calories"
More: "one in 10 meals had more than 1600 calories"
Less: "meals with fewer than 650 calories"

2. 3 different methods for each type
process_spike
process_more
process_less

Each method will return:
The x-y coordinates of the relevant bar

3. Write the relevant coordinates of the highlight shapes into visualization/coordinates.txt
    CIRCLE: x-coordinate of midpoint, y-coordinate of midpoint, radius
    RECTANGLE: width, height, x-coordinate of upper-left corner, y-coordinate of upper-left corner

4. Create a copy of the edited srt code and move it into visualization folder as visualization/output.srt

Final output:
A txt file (coordinates.txt) containing all the necessary coordinates.
