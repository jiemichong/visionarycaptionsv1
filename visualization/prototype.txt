The histogram above
shows the distribution of 
calories for all orders.
The spike around 
1000 calories represents
standard burrito orders
a meat burrito 
with typical additions
cheese, salsa, lettuce, 
sour-cream, rice and beans.
If you order a 
meat burrito at Chipotle
with these toppings,
it's very likely to 
reach 1000 calories
but there's so much 
more to these data
than the averages.
Chipotle customers 
can and do order meals 
with fewer than 
650 calories such as a 
cheese-free burrito bowl.
On the other end
of the spectrum 
about 1 in 10 meals 
have more than 1600 calories.
