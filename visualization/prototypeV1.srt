00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,600
The histogram above

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,799
shows the distribution of calories for

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,720
all orders.

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,160
The spike around 1000 calories represents

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,480
standard burrito orders

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,359
a meat burrito with typical additions

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:17,920
cheese,

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,480
salsa, lettuce, sour, cream, rice and beans.

If you order a meat burrito at chipotle

00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,160
it's very likely to reach 1000 calories

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,920
but there's so much more to these data

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,840
than the averages.

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,239
Chipotle customers can and do order

15
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,120
meals with fewer than

00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,280
650 calories such as a cheese-free

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,280
burrito bowl.

18
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,520
On the other end of the spectrum about

19
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,280
1 in 10 meals have more than 1600
